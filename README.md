## Key features
- **Filters SNVs from any variant caller to remove false positives**
- **Calculates metrics based on BAM files and provides filtering not possible with other tools**
- **Fully user-configurable filtering (including which filters to use and their thresholds)**
- **Option to use filters identical to ICGC recommendations**

## Introduction
Somatic variant callers compare matched pairs of tumor-normal samples to produce variant calls. The results can be extremely rich in false positives due to confounding factors such as the purity of the samples, artifacts introduced by sequencing chemistry, the alignment algorithm and the incomplete and repetitive nature of reference genomes.  
It has become common practice to attempt to ameliorate these effects using a variety of filtering techniques, including taking the intersect of results from multiple variant callers and employing some post-calling filtering. This ad-hoc filtering varies greatly between laboratories.  Attempts have been made to standardize the methodology of this filtering, with recommendations produced by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) [(Alioto et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682041/).  
We have developed Filters for Next Generation Sequencing (FiNGS), software written specifically to address these filtering issues. FiNGS can implement the ICGC filtering standards and has filters and thresholds that are fully configurable, which substantially increases the precision of results and provides high quality variants for further analysis. 

## Availability
FiNGS is open source and released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). The latest source code is [freely available at GitHub](https://github.com/cpwardell/FiNGS).

## Dependencies
Python 3

## Quickstart guide, with example data and test
You have three options for running FiNGS; 
1. Download using Bioconda (preferred)
2. Download directly from GitHub
3. Download using Docker/Singularity

### Bioconda installation
Create new conda environment
Install package (and dependencies)
Run example


### Standalone installation via GitHub
FiNGS depends on Python3 and several packages. We recommend using a Conda environment to manage Python and associated packages.
On Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, you can install Python3 and pip, the recommended tool for installing Python packages using the following commands:

```
apt-get -y install python3
apt-get -y install python3-pip
```

Now Python3 and pip are installed, you may install the required Python packages:
```
pip3 install PyVCF
pip3 install pysam
pip3 install editdistance
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install joblib
```

Clone the git repository and run the included example script in the `exampledata` directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/cpwardell/FiNGS.git
cd FiNGS/exampledata
./test.sh
```
You should see the progress printed to the screen. When filtering is complete, a `results` directory will have been created containing the output.

### Docker installation
This guide assumes you have Docker installed and have some basic knowledge on how to use it. The Dockerfile builds an image based on Ubuntu 16.04. 
You need to get a copy of the Dockerfile in this repository; below we use "wget" on Linux to download it, but you could just as easily 
copy and paste the link in your web browser and "right click/save as" the file. The Docker build command works identically in both Bash on Linux and PowerShell on Windows
and assumes that you're in the same directory as the dockerfile named "Dockerfile".

```
# Download the Dockerfile from this address:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpwardell/FiNGS/master/Dockerfile
# Build the image and call it "fings" (lowercase)
docker build -t fings .
```

You can test that your image works by running a container interactively:
```
docker run -it fings
cd /FiNGS/exampledata
./test.sh
```

When you run it on your own data, you can mount the location of your files as below. This would output a results directory in the directory the command was executed in. Note that the `-u` argument ensures that files created by the 
docker container will be owned by the user invoking the docker.
```
docker run -v /path/to/tumorbamdir:/tumorbamdir -v /path/to/normalbamdir:/normalbamdir -v /path/to/vcfdir:/vcfdir -v $PWD:/local -w /local -u $UID:$UID fings /bin/bash -c "python3 /FiNGS/FiNGS.py -n /normalbamdir/normal.bam -t /tumorbamdir/tumor.bam -v /vcfdir/somatic.vcf --PASSonlyin --PASSonlyout"
```

## Suggested usage
+ Use default filtering thresholds
+ Use every available processor
+ Only consider variants with a PASS filter value from the variant caller
+ Only emit variants that PASS all filters  

```
python3 /path/to/FiNGS.py -n /path/to/normal.bam -t /path/to/tumor.bam -v /path/to/somaticvariants.vcf --PASSonlyin --PASSonlyout
```

+ ICGC mode:

```
python3 /path/to/FiNGS.py -n /path/to/normal.bam -t /path/to/tumor.bam -v /path/to/somaticvariants.vcf -r /path/to/reference/genome.fasta --PASSonlyin --PASSonlyout --ICGC
```

## Basic usage and outputs
In the simplest case, provide FiNGS with paths to a VCF from a somatic variant caller and the BAM files used to produce it.
```
python3 FiNGS.py -n /path/to/normal.bam -t /path/to/tumor.bam -v /path/to/somaticvariants.vcf
```

FiNGS will create a directory called "results" containing the following files:

+ `inputvcf.filtered.vcf`  
A VCF containing the filtered results. Descriptions of the filters used and their threshold values are stored in the header, and PASS/fail status stored in the FILTER column of each record
+ `plots.pdf`  
Plots for every filter applied in a single PDF. The first page shows a table of the PASS/Fail counts for each filter. Subsequent pages show kernel density plots of the data used, with a dashed vertical line demarcating the threshold used; the red region failed the filter, the green region passed
+ `log.txt`  
The log file for the run. Contains the command line arguments used and a complete log of the run
+ `filterresults.txt.gz`  
A gzipped text file giving the results of each filter for every variant 
+ `tumor.combined.txt.gz` and `normal.combined.txt.gz`  
All metrics collected and used for filtering are stored in these gzipped text files. A dictionary explaining the contents of each column is below
+ `summarystats.txt.gz`
A gzipped text file containing summary stats that may be used for filtering

## Advanced usage

+ **-v** Required; path to the somatic variant VCF from any variant caller
+ **-t** Required; path to the tumor BAM file used to produce the VCF
+ **-n** Required; path to the normal BAM file used to produce the VCF
+ **-r** Optional; absolute path to faidx indexed reference genome; required if using 'repeats' filter 
+ **-d** Optional; path to output directory.  Default is to create a directory called "results" in the current working directory
+ **-p** Optional; path to file specifying filtering parameters. Details on filters and default values is provided below. Default is a file located at `FiNGS/filter_parameters.txt`
+ **-c** Optional; chunk size, the number of variants to process per chunk. Default is 100
+ **-m** Optional; maximum read depth. Reads beyond this depth will be ignored and a warning emitted to the log file. Default is 1000 
+ **-j** Optional; number of processors to use. -1 uses all available. Default is -1 
+ **--ICGC** Optional; use filters identical to those recommended by the ICGC (Alioto et al, 2015). File is located at `FiNGS/icgc_filter_parameters.txt`
+ **--logging** Optional; change logging level. Default is INFO, can be DEBUG for more detail or NOTSET for silent
+ **--overwrite** Optional; allow overwriting of existing results if rerunning  
+ **--PASSonlyin** Optional; only consider variants with a PASS in the filter field of the input VCF  
+ **--PASSonlyout** Optional; only write variants that PASS all filters to the output VCF

## Description of filters
FiNGS assesses variants using any combination of these possible filters. Below is a table describing them, their default thresholds and ICGC thresholds.  NA values mean that the filter is not employed in eithe the default or ICGC mode.  Users can create their own parameter file using *any* combination of filters and thresholds.

+ **Note on _foxog_ filter**  
C>A|G>T variants can be oxidation artifacts introduced during library preparation [(Costello et al, 2013)](http://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1443).
These "OxoG" artifacts have a telltale read orientation, with the majority of ALT reads in the artifact orientation. All C>A|G>T variants are classified as being part of two binomial distributions, one centered at 0.5 (50% artifact orientation, 50% non-artifact orientation) and the other at the filter value (defautl is 0.9, which is 90% artifact orientation reads).  C>A|G>T variants classified as OxoG are removed.

+ **Note on _strandbiasprop_ filter**  
Strand bias is defined below [(Guo et al., 2012)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-666) where a,c represent the forward and reverse strand allele counts of REF reads and b,d represent the forward and reverse strand allele counts of ALT reads.  The topmost proportion of biased variants is removed (e.g. suggested value is 0.1, leading to the top 10% variants with the highest strand bias being removed. Note that this is not the GATK strand bias, which is calculated differently. Note that this filter is available, but is *not* implemented in either of the default settings.  
Strand bias: |b/(a+b)-d/(c+d)|/ ((b+d)/(a+b+c+d))  
GATK strand bias: max(((b/(a+b))&ast;(c/(c+d)))/((a+c)/(a+b+c+d)),((d/(c+d))&ast;(a/(a+b)))/((a+c)/(a+b+c+d)))

+ **Note on _strandbiassimple_ filter**  
Maximum strand bias. This is defined very simply as the minimum proportion of reads in either direction. e.g. if there were 100 reads and only 1 were forward, strand bias would be 0.01.
Strand bias: min(forward/(forward+reverse),reverse/(reverse+forward)) or min((a+b)/(a+b+c+d),(c+d)/(a+b+c+d))

+ **Note on _SNVcluster50_ and _SNVcluster100_ filters**  
Maximum number of SNVs in the input VCF in a 50 or 100 bp window centered on the current SNV.  SNVs must have at least 2 reads supporting them and a VAF>=5%.

+ **Note on _repeats_ filter**  
Maximum length of 1/2/3/4mers surrounding the SNV. Lengths must be factors of repeats e.g. n=8 would only consider 1/2/4mers because 3 is not a factor of 8.  Repeated regions frequently result in false positive variants.  When using this filter, a reference genome *must* be supplied so FiNGS can find the flanking sequences.

## Dictionary of values reported in the metrics files
The gzipped `tumor.combined.txt.gz` and `normal.combined.txt.gz` output files contain all metrics calculated for every input variant. Each row is a single variant. Non-integer values are rounded to 3 decimal places. Not all of the values reported are used for filtering.
